The focus is on predicting the quality of wine based on its chemical characteristics, offering a real-world application of machine learning in the context of viticulture. The dataset encompasses diverse chemical attributes, including density and acidity, which serve as the features for three distinct classifier models.
# Data Analytics Projects

## Project Overview

### Wine Quality Prediction

In this project, the goal is to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical properties. The project involves:

- Data preprocessing and handling missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the relationship between features and wine quality
- Building classification models
- Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation

## Data

- **House Price Dataset**: Contains data on house prices along with features such as location, size, and amenities.
- **Wine Quality Dataset**: Includes chemical properties of different wines and their corresponding quality ratings.
- **Sales Data**: Contains historical sales data including product, time, location, and revenue details.

Datasets can be found in the `data/` directory.

## Installation

To run these projects locally, you'll need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage

Each project has its own Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file located in the `notebooks/` directory. To run the analysis:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the corresponding notebook and run the cells sequentially.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-analysis-projects.git
cd data-analysis-projects
jupyter notebook
